OpenFPGA-FROG_12nm-Infrastructure is the repository containing all the informations regarding LNIS's FROG12nm based boards.
Here is a description of this repository content, more detailled Readmes to be found inside each directory.

# Pre-requisites

Operating system:

There is no operating system hard requirement, however development has been done under <complete OS> hence we recommend using this one especially when working on the firmware.

Development tools:
